	During this workshop, the following topics I have learned about were the difference between internal and external linkage within a C++ project and what a static variable is and how it helped me complete this project. The difference between internal and external links are that internal use static and the variable lives until the end of the program. Internal variables can be accessed through the current document/cpp file it is declared in. External links use extern to define them and can be accessed globally but, only defined once. Within my project I used the static when I had to implement a counter for times the function display was called. I used a static variable for this because the counter variable needed to be accessed throughout the lifetime of the program and the value had to stay in memory through the duration of the program. The changes I made for my Event class to allow for memory allocation were a deconstructor, copy constructor and a copy assignment constructor. I needed these three constructors for the second part of the workshop because the main used copy and copy assignment constructors. I added the deconstructor to deallocate memory at the end of the program. The only problem I had in this workshop was figuring out why the stored archive descriptions were corrupt. After analyzing the code, I figured out that it used a copy assignment with the class, and I had to add one to solve the problem. 


Quiz One Reflection
